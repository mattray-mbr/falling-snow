This project started from the tutuorial from https://www.developphp.com/video/JavaScript/Particle-Effect-System-Tutorial-Snow-Falling-Animation
My plan is to take this as a starting point and modify it in multiple ways as a way to practice working with javascript and canvas. 
things to add
    - click start and stop (half done)
    - rotate out background pictures
    - multi-directional snow falling
    - style the border and background around the picture
    - randomize the density of snowfall
    - correctly size background images of multiple sizes
